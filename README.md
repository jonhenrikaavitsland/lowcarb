# Low Carb Meal Planner

A personal project, for personal use. 

The planner will allow me to put together my meals on a daily basis or for a longer period of time.

## Benefits I want to get out of this project:

1. I want to motivate my self
2. I want to make sure I stay within budget when I plan my meals. 
3. I want to ensure my macros are good. 
4. I want to be able to create a "to the point" shopping list.
